# Journey to web-dev with F#

This is a series of blogpost that follow the journey of developming my first web app for my computer science thesis project, using functional paradigms with F#.

I hope to share and record my thoughts and ideas, both the pre-existing ones that influenced the conception of this project, and the newcomers that I pick up along the trail. Read on if you are interested in the perspective of someone coming from a c++ and c# desktop dev background to the wild west of web-dev and functional programming.

## 1. [Motivation](motivation.md)
Where you can read all about the motivation behind this webapp in general.
## 2. [SAFE Stack](safe_stack.md)
A quick overview of the stack used and it's main promises.
## 3. F# - TODO
Overview of the language, what makes it noteworthy and a good fit for this project in my eyes.
## 4. SQL AST: the core idea - TODO
A rundown of my core idea for the domain model of the webapp, and how can it be implemented with the tools a functional programming language provides.
## 5. Shared web API definition - TODO
How does code sharing work, and how it leads to frictionless and less error prone communication between front- and back-end.
