# Journey to web-dev with F#

This is a series of blogpost that follow the journey of developming my first web app for my computer science thesis project, using functional paradigms with F#.

I hope to share and record my thoughts and ideas, both the pre-existing ones that influenced the conception of this project, and the newcomers that I pick up along the trail. Read on if you are interested in the perspective of someone coming from a c++ and c# desktop dev background to the wild west of web-dev and functional programming.
